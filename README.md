# ToolExtractor

This console application when running, it copies all the necessary files into the correct folder so the Autodesk Inventor software can be updated automatically without the designers help, 
therefore eliminating any human error.

It copies templates, design data, any new addin we made, new geometries, new rules etc. Before this any files that were changed had to be uploaded by the designers one file by one
into the correct directory.
